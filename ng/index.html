          NG Stories is a multi-room installation at The National Gallery designed to celebrate the history of the 
          gallery and the people who have shaped it. In the People Room, visitors become part of the story — their 
          silhouettes captured, blended, and displayed alongside archival images from the gallery's past.<br /><br />
          For NG Stories at The National Gallery, I was in charge of the development of the People Room media system — 
          a custom multi-screen installation designed to showcase archival images and portraits in an atmospheric, 
          layered way.

        <p class="after-the-success-of">
          After the success of the first TateDraw, other locations were added.<br /><br />I contributed to select the
          new location by producing renders and mockups to visualise installation layout, projection mapping, and
          overall visitor flow.
