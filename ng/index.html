          The Workers - Tate Draw<br />Role: Developer<br />Tate Modern &amp; Tate Britain, London July 2022 -
          Ongoing<br /><br />Tate Draw is an installation that playfully explores drawing. <br />The audience can choose
          a variety of drawing modes and canvas.<br />Once finished, their drawing is displayed in a projected animated
          gallery.<br /><br />I developed the custom drawing engine behind the experience, building dynamic tools like
          brushes, eraser, and undo functionality.<br />The system features multiple playful drawing modes — including
          Mirror, Pixel, Single Line, and Memory — each designed to inspire creativity in a different way.
        </p>
        <p class="after-the-success-of">
          After the success of the first TateDraw, other locations were added.<br /><br />I contributed to select the
          new location by producing renders and mockups to visualise installation layout, projection mapping, and
          overall visitor flow.
