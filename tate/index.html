          Tate Draw is an installation that playfully explores drawing. The audience can choose a variety of drawing 
          modes and canvas. Once finished, their drawing is displayed in a projected animated gallery.<br /><br />
          I developed the custom drawing engine behind the experience, building dynamic tools like brushes, eraser, 
          and undo functionality. The system features multiple playful drawing modes — including Mirror, Pixel, 
          Single Line, and Memory — each designed to inspire creativity in a different way.
