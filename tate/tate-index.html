          The Workers - NG Stories<br />Role: Developer (Unity, C#, Python)<br />National Gallery, London
          Oct2024-Jan2025<br /><br />NG Stories is a multi-room installation at The National Gallery designed to
          celebrate the history of the gallery and the people who have shaped it. In the People Room, visitors become
          part of the story — their silhouettes captured, blended, and displayed alongside archival images from the
          gallery’s past.<br /><br />For NG Stories at The National Gallery, I was in charge of the development of the
          People Room media system — a custom multi-screen installation designed to showcase archival images and
          portraits in an atmospheric, layered way.

        <p class="built-in-unity-the">
          Built in Unity, the system features a bespoke media player architecture composed of a master controller and
          multiple client displays, each showing different content. Timing, sequencing, and transitions are fully
          customisable via an editor tool I developed specifically for the project.<br /><br />To add an interactive
          layer, I created a real-time camera system that captures visitors using depth cameras, blends them with
          AI-powered human segmentation (Python), and integrates them seamlessly into the projected visuals.<br /><br />As
          part of the development process, I built a VR simulation of the room (Unity, Blender) to prototype the
          experience, check the networking system, visualise the layout, and test ideas with the team and stakeholders
          early on.
