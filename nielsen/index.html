          For the interactive part, i was in charge of developing a memory-inspired interactive game in Unity, designed
          to evoke the idea of recalling fragments of Carl Nielsen's life and music. Visitors interact with a large
          touchscreen to reveal hidden images and sounds, matching elements together to discover stories and
          compositions connected to the composer.<br />This game was designed to be simple, tactile, and intuitive —
          encouraging visitors of all ages to explore and play.

          A key element of the exhibition was its distinctive visual language, woven throughout the museum. I
          contributed by producing animated projections (After Effects) and preparing assets optimised for large-scale
          projection across the different spaces.

          The Workers - NG Stories<br />Role: Deveper, Motion Graphic (Unity, C#, After Effects)<br /><br />At the Carl
          Nielsen Museum in Odense, visitors explore the life and work of the famous Danish composer through a series of
          playful, interactive installations. The exhibition blends music, images, and personal stories, inviting
          visitors to engage with Nielsen's legacy not just as a historical figure, but as a living presence — to be
          discovered, remembered, and reinterpreted through sound and interaction.
