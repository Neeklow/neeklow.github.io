        <p class="project-subtitle">Role: Developer<br />Carl Nielsen Museum, Odense</p>
        <p class="for-the-interactive">
          For the interactive part, i was in charge of developing a memory-inspired interactive game in Unity, designed
          to evoke the idea of recalling fragments of Carl Nielsen's life and music. Visitors interact with a large
          touchscreen to reveal hidden images and sounds, matching elements together to discover stories and
          compositions connected to the composer.<br />This game was designed to be simple, tactile, and intuitive —
          encouraging visitors of all ages to explore and play.
        </p>
        <p class="text-wrapper">
          A key element of the exhibition was its distinctive visual language, woven throughout the museum. I
          contributed by producing animated projections (After Effects) and preparing assets optimised for large-scale
          projection across the different spaces.
