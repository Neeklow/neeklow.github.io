          Superflux · Invocation for Hope<br />Role: Creative Technologist &amp; Visualisation Lead<br />MAK Biennale,
          Vienna May2021 - Oct2021<br /><br /><br />Invocation for Hope was an immersive installation by Superflux for
          the Vienna Biennale, transforming the museum space into a living forest — a reflection on climate change,
          adaptation, and the fragile balance between nature and technology.<br /><br />My main contribution focused on
          the technical design and prototyping that supported the installation's physical setup. I created detailed 3D
          visualisations (Blender) to study and define the final layout of trees, grow lights, and projections — helping
          the team anticipate spatial challenges and refine the visitor experience.<br />To ensure the survival of the
          plants indoors, I researched and calculated the lighting requirements, working out the optimal positioning and
          configuration of the growlights.<br /><br />Additionally, I developed an interactive element using a Raspberry
          Pi and proximity sensors: as visitors approached the central pond, hidden projections beneath the water would
          reveal themselves, adding a subtle interactive layer to the environment.

          Additionally, I developed an interactive element using a Raspberry Pi and proximity sensors to create a subtle
          but magical moment within the space. As visitors approached the central pond, the system would detect their
          presence and trigger a hidden projection beneath the surface of the water — revealing videos of animals coming
          to drink, gently overlaying onto the visitor's own reflection.
